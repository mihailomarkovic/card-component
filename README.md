# Card Component

This repository contains my solution to the Stats Preview Card Component challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). The challenge was to create a responsive card component with a clean and visually appealing design that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to practice building responsive layouts using **HTML** and **CSS** while maintaining a focus on semantic markup and design best practices. The card highlights key stats with bold, attention-grabbing visuals and an emphasis on accessibility.

## Features

- Responsive design optimized for both mobile and desktop views.
- Clean and simple layout built with **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid**.
- Use of custom CSS properties to ensure consistency and scalability.

## What I Learned

This project reinforced my understanding of:

1. Creating responsive layouts using media queries.
2. Combining Flexbox and CSS Grid for efficient layout structuring.
3. Applying background overlays and filters to enhance images.

Hereâ€™s an example of one of the techniques I used for the image background:

```css
.img-box {
  background: linear-gradient(rgba(170, 92, 219, 0.6), rgba(170, 92, 219, 0.6)),
    url("./images/image-header-desktop.jpg");
  filter: contrast(200%) grayscale(20%) brightness(0.6);
  background-size: cover;
  background-position: center;
  border-radius: 0 11px 11px 0;
}
```
